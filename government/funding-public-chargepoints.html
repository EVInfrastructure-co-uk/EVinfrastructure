<h1>Funding Public Chargepoints</h1>
        <p>The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV, formerly OLEV for <i>Low</i> Emission Vehicles) have funded several schemes for public chargepoints. This page gives more details on how they work and how they can be benefit you.</p>
        <p>Some OZEV public charging schemes were open to the whole of the UK. However, the ongoing Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure scheme is only for England. This page refers to schemes in Scotland and Wales, but more information is available on our <a href="/government/scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="/government/wales">Wales</a> pages.</p>
        <p>For information on grant schemes for home chargers, please see our <a href="/home-charging/grants">home charging grants</a> page.</p>

           <p>LEVI is England's flagship programme for near-home public charging, with £381m of capital funding for new chargepoints across the country. OZEV transfers this funding to highway authorities, who then set up tenders for the contract in their area.</p>
            <p>It is understood that LEVI will be the last government grant for near-home public chargepoints for some time, however there is no deadline on when your highway authority might spend their LEVI fund. It could go towards new chargepoint installations for years to come.</p>
            <p>To see how much your highway authority has received under LEVI, and how it is spending it, please enter your postcode:</p>
