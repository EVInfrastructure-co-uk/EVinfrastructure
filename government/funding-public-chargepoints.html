<h1>Funding Public Chargepoints</h1>
        <p>The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV, formerly OLEV for <i>Low</i> Emission Vehicles) have funded several schemes for public chargepoints. This page gives more details on how they work and how they can be benefit you.</p>
        <p>Some OZEV public charging schemes were open to the whole of the UK. However, the ongoing Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure scheme is only for England. This page refers to schemes in Scotland and Wales, but more information is available on our <a href="/government/scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="/government/wales">Wales</a> pages.</p>
        <p>For information on grant schemes for home chargers, please see our <a href="/home-charging/grants">home charging grants</a> page.</p>
        <p>For information on local implementation of the below programmes, please find your local authority below:</p>

  <h2 id="levi">Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI, 2022-present, England)</h2>
           <p>LEVI is England's flagship programme for near-home public charging, with £381m of capital funding for new chargepoints across the country. OZEV transfers this funding to highway authorities, who then set up tenders for the contract in their area.</p>
            <p>It is understood that LEVI will be the last government grant for near-home public chargepoints for some time, however there is no deadline on when your highway authority might spend their LEVI fund. It could go towards new chargepoint installations for years to come.</p>
            <p>To see how much your highway authority has received under LEVI, and how it is spending it, please enter your postcode at the top of the page.</p>

  <h2 id="rcf">Rapid Charging Fund (RCF, 2023 pilot, now scrapped, UK-wide)</h2>
  <p>The idea of the Rapid Charging Fund was to invest in expensive grid upgrades for en-route charging on motorways and major trunk roads. It never came to fruition.</p>
  <p>In March 2020's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020">Budget</a>, Boris Johnson's Conservative government announced £500m of investment in electric vehicle infrastructure, which would include a Rapid Charging Fund.</p>
  <p>By November 2020's publication of the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fbe11b18fa8f559da0f16b4/NIS_final_print.pdf#page=56">National Infrastructure Strategy</a>, the figure had increased to £950m.</p>
  <p>In July 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-charging-market-study-final-report/final-report"></a>study into EV infrastructure in the UK, which welcomed the Rapid Charging Fund. However, it also opened an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into existing arrangements between the chargepoint operator Electric Highway (now GRIDSERVE) and three motorway service area operators: MOTO, Roadchef, and Extra.</p>
  <p>By March 2022, the investigation had finished and the Competition and Markets Authority had secured <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-unlocks-electric-vehicle-charging-competition-for-motorway-drivers"></a>commitments from GRIDSERVE which would enable the RCF to proceed without worsening monopoly powers.</p>
  <p>In May 2023, OZEV <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/referral-for-the-rapid-charging-fund-pilot-scheme-by-the-office-of-zero-emission-vehicles">referred itself</a> to the Subsidy Advice Unit in regard to the Rapid Charging Fund. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-on-the-rapid-charging-fund-pilot-scheme">report</a> was published in in June 2023.</p>
  <p>In Winter 2023-24, Rishi Sunak's Conservative government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/rapid-charging-fund-scheme-design/rapid-charging-fund-scheme-design">consulted</a> on how to implement the Rapid Charging Fund. The pilot concluded without making any awards.</p>
  <p>In summer 2025, Keir Starmer's Labour government quietly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-on-the-strategic-road-network/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-on-the-strategic-road-network">scrapped</a> the RCF, around the same time as announcing £400m for charging in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2025-document/spending-review-2025-html#growth-and-clean-energy">Spending Review</a>.</p>
