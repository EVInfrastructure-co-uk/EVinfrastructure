<h1>The Scottish Government and EVI</h1>
<p>The Scottish Government has invested a great deal into EV charging, and the Scottish public charging network is amongst the best in the country.</p>
<p>Transport Scotland have an Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Project (EVIP) Board which directs EVI programmes in Scotland.</p>
<h2>Funding public chargepoints</h2>

<h3 id="evif">Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Fund (EVIF, 2022-present)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/our-approach/environment/electric-vehicle-infrastructure-fund/">Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Fund</a> is Scotland's current scheme aimed at on-street charging.</p>
<p>Of the 32 councils in Scotland, all except East Lothian and Stirling have proceeded to an EVIF project. Dundee City Council is operating its project alone. The other 29 councils are grouped into six partnerships.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government and Transport Scotland use £30m as the project investment in their communications. This includes £4.48m for strategy and procurement, and £25.52m for subsidy of public chargepoints.</p>
