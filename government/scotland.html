<p>The <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/our-approach/environment/electric-vehicle-infrastructure-fund/">Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Fund</a> is Scotland's current scheme aimed at on-street charging.</p>
<p>Of the 32 councils in Scotland, all except East Lothian and Stirling have proceeded to an EVIF project. Dundee City Council is operating its project alone. The other 29 councils are grouped into six partnerships.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government and Transport Scotland give the figure of £30m for project investment. This includes £4.48m for strategy and procurement, and £25.52m for subsidy of public chargepoints.</p>
