<h1>The Northern Ireland Executive and EVI</h1>
<p>Of the four nations in the UK, Northern Ireland is the only one not to have a scheme currently running where local authorities set up contracts with chargepoint operators to improve public charging provision.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is the only nation with a nationwide pavement channel trial.</p>

<h2 id="funding-public-chargepoints">Funding public chargepoints</h2>
<p>There are no public chargepoint schemes specific to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>However, Northern Irish authorities have claimed funding under the UK Government's <a href="/government/funding-public-chargepoints#orcs">On-Street Charging Scheme</a>. In 2022, an nine-council consortium led by Derry and Strabane City Council <a href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/news/funding-boost-electric-vehicle-charge-points-residential-areas-welcomed">was awarded</a> £1,348,370 in ORCS funding, which the Northern Irish Department for Infrastructure boosted with a further £500,000. In November 2025, Weev were <a href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/news/minister-kimmins-and-deputy-mayor-welcome-awarding-ev-charge-point-contract-council-areas">announced</a> as the chargepoint operator for the scheme, which aims to deliver over 250 public chargepoints.</p>
<h2 id="grants">Grants for home chargers</h2>
<p>There are no grants for home chargers specific to Northern Ireland, and the Northern Ireland Executive <a href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/articles/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-and-infrastructure-grants">directs</a> residents to UK Government schemes, on which we have a page <a href="/home-charging/grants">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dfi">The Department for Infrastructure as highway authority</h2>
<p>In Northern Ireland, the Deparment for Infrastructure is highway authority across the country.</p>
<h3 id="channels">Pavement channels</h3>
<p>In September 2025, the Department for Infrastructure <a href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/news/kimmins-launches-electric-vehicle-cross-pavement-charging-trial">announced</a> a trial of <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channels</a> across Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>To participate in the pilot, email <a href="mailto:TDU@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk">TDU@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk</a>. While public information on the trial is scarce, the DfI has published this internal <a href="https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2025-10/permanent-sub-surface-cross-pavement-channels-for-charging-electric-vehicles.pdf">guidance</a> for staff dealing with requests for a Street Works Licence for a pavement channel. This can be read as instructions for the process in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h3 id="trailing">Trailing cables</h3>
<p>The DfI is also trialling use of a temporary cable protector. Details are at the same link as pavement channels, above.</p>
<h2 id="legislation">Legislation</h2>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2011/25/contents">Planning Act (Northern Ireland) 2011</a> is the principal planning legislation in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The legislation does not mention electric vehicles by name, and we are continuing to investigate whether planning permission is necessary for home chargers in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h3 id="highway-law">Highway Law</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1993/3160">Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993</a> applies in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>In particular, it is illegal to <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels#trailing">trail cables</a> over the footway (except under the <a href="#trailing">DfI pilot</a> discussed above):</p>

<p>Independent of the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government, Northern Ireland has a particularly strong association for EV drivers and potential converts. The EVANI website is <a href="https://evani.uk/">here</a>.</p>
