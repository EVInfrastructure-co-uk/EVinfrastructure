<h1>The Northern Ireland Executive and EVI</h1>
<p>Of the four nations in the UK, Northern Ireland is the only one not to have a scheme currently running where local authorities set up contracts with chargepoint operators to improve public charging provision.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is the only nation with a nationwide pavement channel trial.</p>
<h2>Funding public chargepoints</h2>
<p>There are no public chargepoint schemes specific to Northern Ireland, however Northern Irish authorities have claimed funding under the UK Government's <a href="/government/funding-public-chargepoints#orcs">On-Street Charging Scheme</a>. In 2022, an 11-council consortium led by Derry and Strabane City Council <a href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/news/funding-boost-electric-vehicle-charge-points-residential-areas-welcomed">was awarded</a> £1,348,370 in ORCS funding, which the Northern Irish Department for Infrastructure boosted with a further £500,000.</p>
<h2>Grants for home chargers</h2>
<p>There are no grants for home chargers specific to Northern Ireland, and the Northern Ireland Executive <a href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/articles/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-and-infrastructure-grants">directs</a> residents to UK Government schemes, on which we have a page <a href="/home-charging/grants">here</a>.</p>
<h2>The Department for Infrastructure as highway authority</h2>
<p>In Northern Ireland, the Deparment for Infrastructure is highway authority across the country.</p>
<h3>Pavement channels</h3>
<p>In September 2025, the Department for Infrastructure <a href="https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/news/kimmins-launches-electric-vehicle-cross-pavement-charging-trial">announced</a> a trial of <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channels</a> across Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>To participate in the pilot, email <a href="mailto:TDU@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk">TDU@infrastructure-ni.gov.uk</a>. While public information on the trial is scarce, the DfI has published this internal <a href="https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2025-10/permanent-sub-surface-cross-pavement-channels-for-charging-electric-vehicles.pdf">guidance</a> for staff dealing with requests for a Street Works Licence for a pavement channel. This can be read as instructions for the process in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h3 id="trailing">Trailing cables</h3>
<p>The DfI is also trialling use of a temporary cable protector.</p>
<h2>Legislation</h2>

<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2011/25/contents">Planning Act (Northern Ireland) 2011</a> is the principal planning legislation in Northern Ireland.</p>
