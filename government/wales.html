<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.wales/ultra-low-emission-vehicle-transformation-fund-grants-awarded-2023-2024-html">second edition of ULEVTF</a> sees all areas of Wales receive funding. Some councils only receive funding as part of the Cardiff Capital Region.</p>

<h3 id="ulevtf">Ultra low emission vehicle transformation fund (ULEVTF) 2020-21</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.wales/ultra-low-emission-vehicle-transformation-fund-grants-awarded-2020-2021-html">first edition of ULEVTF</a> was much smaller than the more recent iteration. It only featured funding in three councils beyond the Cardiff City Region.</p>
<p>Some projects funded by ULEVTF in 2020-21 went beyond EV chargepoints, including solar ports and an EV roadshow.</p>
<h2>Grants for home chargers</h2>
<p>There are no grants for home chargers specific to Wales, however the UK Government's <a href="/home-charging/grants">grants</a> apply.</p>
<h2>Legislation</h2>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/418/contents">The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995</a> applies in Wales, with specific <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2019/330/made">amendments</a> in 2019 that apply to EV charging. These amendments very closely match the corresponding text in England's The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.</p>
<p>Except in the case of listed buildings or pavement channels, you are unlikely to need planning permission to install a home charger in Wales.</p>
<h3>Highway Law</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66">Highways Act 1980</a> applies in Wales (as well as England).</p>
<p>In particular, the act discourages <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels#trailing">trailing cables</a> over the pavement, but is vague as to the threshold for an offence:</p>
<div><h4><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/162">Highways Act 1980, Section 162</a>: Penalty for placing rope, etc. across highway.</h4>
<p><i>A person who for any purpose places any rope, wire or other apparatus across a highway in such a manner as to be likely to cause danger to persons using the highway is, unless he proves that he had taken all necessary means to give adequate warning of the danger, guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding [level 3 on the standard scale].</i></p>
</div>
<h3>Street works law</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/22/contents">New Roads and Street Works Act 1991</a> applies in Wales (as it does in England).</p>
<p>Chargepoint operators must obtain a Street Works Licence under Section 50 of the Act to install public chargepoints on the public highway.</p>
