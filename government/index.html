    <h2>Introduction to Government and EVI</h2>
    <p>Neither national nor local government set up petrol stations, so why should they get involved with EV infrastructure?</p>
    <p>Firstly, the <a href="/sustainable-travel">climate impact</a> of petrol and diesel cars is severe, and the government consider state involvement necessary to ensure the transition away from fuel cars is as quick as the government's aims for decarbonisation.</p>
    <p>Secondly, many public chargepoints are on highway or other council land, so <a href="/government/local-government">local governments</a> are necessarily involved.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, the capital expenditure needed for EV chargepoints is substantial, and the government can <a href="/government/funding-public-chargepoints">help reduce this barrier</a> to allow the public chargepoint network to stand on its own feet.</p>
