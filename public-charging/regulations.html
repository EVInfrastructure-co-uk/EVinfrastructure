  <h1>Public Charge Point Regulations (PCPR2023)</h1>
    <p>On 23 November 2023, the Public Charge Point Regulations came into force. They were designed to improve user experience at public chargepoints and ensure they work properly as critical national infrastructure.</p>
    <p>You can read the legal text <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/1168/made">here</a>, and Gov.uk's guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-public-charge-point-regulations-2023-guidance/public-charge-point-regulations-2023-guidance">here</a>.</p>
    <p>This page summarises each of the six main requirements, with some commentary on how they can improve your experience, and compliance.</p>
  <h2>The requirements</h2>

  <h3>Pricing Transparency (from November 2023)</h3>
  <h3>Contactless (from November 2024, all chargepoints over 50kW and new chargepoints over 8kW)</h3>
  <h3>99% Reliability (from November 2024, network average across chargepoints over 50kW)</h3>
  <h3>Helpline (from November 2024)</h3>
  <h3>Open data (from November 2024)</h3>
  <p>"A charge point operator must ensure that reference data and availability data is made available to the public free of charge and in a machine readable format without any requirement to agree to terms and conditions regarding the use of that data."</p>
  <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/news/dft-awards-zapmap-contract-deliver-electric-vehicle-chargepoint-open-data">Zapmap has won a contract to help the DfT analyse chargepoint data under the new open regs.</a>
  <h3>Roaming (from November 2025)</h3>
  <h2>Compliance</h2>
  <p>There have been a couple of independent investigations into chargepoint operators' compliance with PCPR 2023, such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-gill-b3a100198_steady-progress-being-made-towards-pcpr-compliance-activity-7288315326474141696-Avr8">this LinkedIn post</a> in January 2025 and this <a href="https://www.fastcharge.email/p/what-i-learned-calling-55-charging">Fast Charge post</a> about helplines in November 2024. Please note that we have included the links for reference but cannot take responsibility for their correctness.</p>
  <p>There are penalties for chargepoint operators who do not comply. These are £10,000 for each public chargepoint breaking each regulation except for 99% reliability. Since 99% reliability is measured across a network, the penalty applies to the network, and is also £10,000.</p>
