<h1>Community charging</h1>
<p>Community charging (or peer-to-peer or shared charging) is 'like Airbnb but for EV charging' (as one company <a href="https://www.mobularayev.com/">puts it</a>). It is somewhere between home charging and public charging. You are charging at a home... but it's someone else's home, the tariff is more like a public charging tariff, and you have to pick your car up again at the end.</p>
<p>The Irish Government has <a href="https://www.zevi.ie/news/minister-announces-grants-for-emotorcycles-espsv-and-new-innovative-charging-pilot-to-boost-ev">backed</a> a trial of shared charging. The UK Government <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6245ba40e90e075f15381cf0/taking-charge-the-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-strategy.pdf">is aware</a> of community charging but has not interfered to date.</p>

<h2>For those seeking to charge</h2>
<p>Cost, distance, and availability are likely to be the key concerns for those seeking a chargepoint... just as they are for public charging!</p>
<p>Distance and availability depend on who is out there making their chargepoints available, but cost is an area where co-charging should be able to beat public charging.</p>
<h2>For those with home chargepoints</h2>
<p>Those with a certain persuasion will recognise the opportunity here from the outset. If you mark up electricity from your chargepoint by 10p/kWh and sell 100kWh a week (15hrs) to a regular customer, then that's an extra £10 a week for virtually nothing.</p>
<p><a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">Pavement channel</a> manufacturers often list community charging amongst the advantages of their product. It is worth bearing in mind that in terraced streets, community charging can turn a solution for one household to cross the <a href="/home-charging/driveway-divide">driveway divide</a> into a solution for several households to cross the divide. If one in four houses have pavement channels, could this enable the whole street to switch?</p>
<p>There is the inconvenience of a stranger parking on your drive, and some might find that too intimate. In France and Spain, carpooling services like <a href="https://www.blablacar.co.uk/">BlaBlaCar</a> see decent uptake, whereas that kind of sharing has never done so well in this country.</p>
<p>There is always the option of finding an arrangement with someone you already know. Letting anyone avoid paying public charging rates by charging on your drive is doing them a favour.</p>
