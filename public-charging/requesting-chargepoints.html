  <h1>Requesting a Public Chargepoint</h1>
  There are three ways you can push for a public chargepoint near you: submit a request to your local authority, submit a request to the chargepoint operator working with your local authority, or submit a request on Vauxhall's Electric Streets database. 
  <h2>Your local authority</h2>
  Many <a href="/government-and-EVI/local-government">local authorities</a> who are managing <a href="/government-and-EVI/funding-public-chargepoints">funded chargepoint</a> programmes collate data on their residents' requests for chargepoints. Check your local authority's EV webpage to see whether they are looking for data on public chargepoint demand:
  <div>
    {% include postcode-search.html %}
  </div>
  <h2>Your local authority's chargepoint operator</h2>
  While local authorities' incentives to put chargepoints in the right place are about public service and optimal siting to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, chargepoint operators want to know where they are going to make money. If you can convince them that you will charge at a certain location, and they will make money off you, then they may take an interest. You can find out which chargepoint operator is working with your local authority by searching your postcode above.
  <h2>Vauxhall's Electric Streets</h2>
  Vauxhall are running an Electric Streets programme in conjunction with CENEX. Your local authority should be able to see the data submitted by residents. <a href="https://www.vauxhall.co.uk/electric/electricstreets/register-your-needs.html">Register your needs</a> through a survey here.
  <h2>Feasibility</h2>
  <p>It is important to understand that neither local authorities nor chargepoint operators install chargepoints based on one person's demand. Moreover, even if they wanted to put a chargepoint where you ask, it may not be feasible.</p>
  <p>Specific requests for a type of charger, such as a lamppost charger or a rapid charger, may be ignored. Some local authorities are reluctant about lamppost chargers, and fast chargers, which are more expensive to install, will not be wasted on areas where they are underutilised.</p>
  <p><strong>Do not</strong> offer to pay for the installation. This will not help your case, and is unlikely to be workable.</p>
  <p>Highway authorities will <strong>not</strong> permit personal chargepoints on the public highway.</p>
