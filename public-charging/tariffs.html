    <h1>Public Charging Tariffs</h1>
    <h2>Tariff indices</h2>
    The <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/charging-price-index">Zapmap Price Index</a> and the <a href="https://www.theaa.com/about-us/newsroom/aa-monthly-ev-recharge-reports">AA Monthly Recharge Report</a> are both excellent sources for national information on charging tariffs, broken down by speed. Similar indices will be coming soon to this website for reference here. A further goal is to break down charging costs on a local level. In the meantime, please find some more general information on tariffs.
    <h2>Why are tariffs so high?</h2>
