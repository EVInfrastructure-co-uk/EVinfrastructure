    <h1>Public Charging Tariffs</h1>
    <h2>Tariff indices</h2>
    The <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/charging-price-index">Zapmap Price Index</a> and the <a href="https://www.theaa.com/about-us/newsroom/aa-monthly-ev-recharge-reports">AA Monthly Recharge Report</a> are both excellent sources for national information on charging tariffs, broken down by speed. Similar indices will be coming soon to this website for reference here. A further goal is to break down charging costs on a local level. In the meantime, please find some more general information on tariffs.
    <h2>Factors affecting tariff</h2>
    <h3>Power</h3>
    <p>Higher power chargers cost more than lower power chargers. You usually pay a premium for ultra-rapid charging.</p>
    <h3>Competition between substitutes</h3>
    <p>If you are a captive consumer, for example because you don't want to leave your car far from home when charging overnight, or you don't want to detour from a motorway when charging en-route somewhere, then the chargepoint operator can set higher prices.</p>
    <p>The Competition and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/electric-vehicle-charging-market-study">investigated</a> motorway charging, and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6554ad2bc684c40013b64da4/Open_letter_to_electric_vehicle_chargepoint_operators_and_motorway_service_area_site_operators__.pdf">found</a> that GRIDSERVE's long-term exclusive contracts with motorway service station operators problematic for price competition.</p>
    <p>As a consumer, there are a couple of ways to fight this. Firstly, vote with your feet and go out of your way for cheaper tariffs if you can. Secondly, encourage public bodies to enter contracts with multiple operators.</p>
    <h3>Chargepoint operator commercial model</h3>
    <p>While some CPOs are standalone businesses, others are arms of larger corporations, which may allow them to make a greater loss on charging (note that all CPOs run at a loss as of 2025).</p>
    <p>Tesla's Superchargers offer comparatively cheap ultra-rapid charging (e.g. peak non-member rate of 55p/kWh for power up to 250kW). They may be able to do this because other parts of the business are making money, or they may have a strategy where the charging arm encourages sales in the car manufacturing arm.</p>
    <h2>Why are tariffs so high?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>VAT is 20% on public charging. Campaigns like <a href="https://www.faircharge.co.uk/">Fair Charge</a> aim to change this.</li>
        <li>The capital expenditure for public charging is considerable and is borne by the public chargepoint operator (perhaps with some <a href="/government-and-EVI/funding-public-chargepoints.html">subsidy</a>). The operators must make this money back again from consumers.</li>
        <li>Price competition is between domestic public chargepoint operators is weak. This is because public chargepoint options are limited by distance and convenience.</li>
        <li>Adrian Fielden-Gray of chargepoint operator Be.EV has <a href="https://www.transportxtra.com/publications/evolution/opinion/77174/the-price-of-ev-charging-look-beyond-the-headlines/">summarised</a> the reasons public charging costs so much: "Public EV charging prices reflect the realities of building a reliable, future-proof network â€” not profiteering."</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Time-of-use and smart tariffs</h2>
    <p>Some chargepoint operators allow you charge cheaper during off-peak hours, usually at night.</p>
    <p>For example, <a href="https://connectedkerb.com/stories-reports-and-events/smart-charging-nationwide-launch/">Connected Kerb</a> offer tariffs which can be 10p/kWh lower from 12am-6am. You don't have to stay up until midnight to take advantage, as you can plug in any time after 7 and use smart charging to schedule your charge during off-peak hours.</p>
