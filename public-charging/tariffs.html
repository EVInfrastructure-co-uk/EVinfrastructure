    <h1>Public Charging Tariffs</h1>
    <h2>Tariff indices</h2>
    The <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/charging-price-index">Zapmap Price Index</a> and the <a href="https://www.theaa.com/about-us/newsroom/aa-monthly-ev-recharge-reports">AA Monthly Recharge Report</a> are both excellent sources for national information on charging tariffs, broken down by speed. Similar indices will be coming soon to this website for reference here. The goal is also to break down charging costs on a local level. In the meantime, please find some more information on tariffs.
    <h2>Why are tariffs so high?</h2>
