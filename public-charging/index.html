    <h1>Public Charging</h1>
    <p>There are 80,000 public chargepoints in the UK, and counting. They are on our streets, in supermarket car parks, council car parks, service stations and dedicated hubs. Costs vary depending on location, supplier, and power. The lowest-power charging tends to be around 50p/kWh, where as high-power charging can be as much as 80p/kWh.</p>
    <p>Public chargepoints are run by chargepoint operators (CPOs), which are analogous to filling station companies. However, the chargepoint operator market is spread much more thinly across numerous suppliers as it continues to expand. It is highly likely there will be consolidation in future.</p>
    <p>EVinfrastructure.co.uk is developing mapping and statistics to analyse the CPO market near you using the open data part of the <a href="/public-charging/regulations">Public Charge Point Regulations 2023</a>. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Zapmap</a> is the recognised market leader in tracking public chargers, and the DfT obtain data from them.</p>
