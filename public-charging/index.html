    <h1>Public Charging</h1>
      <p>There are 85,000 public chargepoints in the UK, and counting. They are on our streets, in supermarket car parks, council car parks, service stations and dedicated hubs. Costs vary depending on location, supplier, and power. The lowest-power charging tends to be around 50p/kWh, where as high-power charging can be as much as 80p/kWh.</p>
      <p>This section of the website contains further details about how the public charging market works on this page, and specific pages on <a href="/public-charging/tariffs">public charging tariffs</a>, <a href="/public-charging/regulations">regulations on public chargepoints</a>, and the <a href="/public-charging/pas-1899">PAS 1899</a> standard which gives best practice for making chargepoints accessible.
    <h2>The chargepoint operator market</h2>
      <p>Public chargepoints are run by chargepoint operators (CPOs), which are analogous to filling station companies. However, the chargepoint operator market is spread much more thinly across numerous suppliers as it continues to expand. It is highly likely there will be consolidation in future.</p>
      <p>As of September 2025, Shell Recharge-Ubitricity have the biggest share of public charging devices, followed by Connected Kerb, Pod, and char.gy. Some CPOs are organisations dedicated to EV charging, while others are subsidiaries of well-known firms in energy or infrastructure. Some have received <a href="/government-and-EVI/funding-public-chargepoints#investment">capital from the taxpayer</a>. Some have a bigger presence overseas, while others are based in the UK.</p>
      <p>At EVinfrastructure.co.uk, we are developing mapping and statistics to analyse the CPO market near you using the open data part of the <a href="/public-charging/regulations">Public Charge Point Regulations 2023</a>. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Zapmap</a> is the recognised market leader in tracking public chargers, and the DfT obtain data from them.</p>
    <h2>Types of public charging</h2>
      <p>NEVIS have <a href="https://nevis.cenex.co.uk/assets/evi_metrics/awnty25/are-we-nearly-there-yet_2025_published_lowerres.pdf">broken down</a> charging into four categories: Near Home Charging, Commercial Charging, Destination Charging, and Journey Charging.</p>
      <p>The distinction between the types is important because the most important features of a chargepoint depend on its use. For near-home charging, distance to home and tariff are the most important factors, whereas high power is much more important for journey charging. Some CPOs specialise in a certain type of charging.</p>
