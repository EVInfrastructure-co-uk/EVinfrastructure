    <h1>Public Charging</h1>
    <p>There are 80,000 public chargepoints in the UK, and counting. These are sited on street, in supermarket car parks, council car parks, service stations and dedicated hubs. Costs vary depending on location, supplier, and power, but the lowest power charging tends to be around 50p/kWh, where as high power charging can be as much as 80p/kWh.</p>
    <p>Public chargepoints are run by chargepoint operators (CPOs), which are analogous to filling station companies. However, there are many more chargepoint operators than filling station companies, as the market is still growing and yet to consolidate.</p>
    <p>EVinfrastructure.co.uk is developing mapping and statistics to analyse the CPO market near you using the open data part of the <a href="/public-charging/regulations">Public Charge Point Regulations 2023</a>. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Zapmap</a> is the recognised market leader in tracking public chargers, and the DfT obtain data from them.</p>
