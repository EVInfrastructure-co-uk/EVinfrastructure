<h2 id="national-government-and-EVI">National government and EVI</h2>
<p>The UK Government is responsible for EVI in England, and some UK-wide functions such as regulation, grants, information and VAT. Each function of government on this page is marked either England or UK. Please see the pages for <a href="/government-and-EVI/scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="/government-and-EVI/wales">Wales</a>, and <a href="/government-and-EVI/ni">Northern Ireland</a> for devolved arrangements for EVI.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-zero-emission-vehicles">Office for Zero Emission Vehicles</a> (OZEV) is the UK Government's main arm for all things EV, including charging. It is part of the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).</p>

      One of OZEV's roles is to subsidise the installation of public chargepoints. This does not mean subsidising the energy dispensed by public chargepoints. There have been various schemes through which the government has subsidised public chargepoints, most notably the On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS) and the Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) fund. See the <a href="/public-charging/funding-public-chargepoints">Funding public chargepoints</a> page for more information. Whilst the money

      <p>OZEV also offer several grants to residents, landlords and businesses wishing to install home charging units at their properties. The full list of these grants is on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grants">this page</a> on the OZEV website, and we have more information about home charging grants <a href="/home-charging/grants">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Note that the <a href="/government-and-EVI/scotland">Scottish government</a> also has grants for some private chargepoints.</p>
      <h3 id="regulating-public-chargepoints">Regulating public chargepoints in the UK</h3>
      OZEV are also in charge of the Public Charge Point Regulations 2023, which ensure that chargepoint operators (CPOs) provide a good service to the public. Please see our <a href="/public-charging/regulations">PCPR2023</a> page for more information.
      <h3 id="information">Information (UK) </h3>
      <p>OZEV's role in providing information on EV charging includes mythbusting and the provision of statistics to the industry and the public.</p>
      <p>OZEV have got an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicles-costs-charging-and-infrastructure/electric-vehicles-costs-charging-and-infrastructure">information page</a> on EVs in general. They also work with AutoTrader on a <a href="https://www.autotrader.co.uk/content/features/electric-cars-facts-and-figures">Facts and Figures</a> guide looking at the main downsides of EVs. However, the Lords Climate Change Committee has previously <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5804/ldselect/ldenvcl/51/5105.htm#_idTextAnchor006">urged</a> the government to do more to build consumer confidence. EVinfrastructure.co.uk seeks to provide information independently of the government.</p>
      <p>Statistics that OZEV produce include <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-statistics#latest-quarterly-electric-vehicle-public-charging-infrastructure-statistics">the number of EV charging devices in each local authority</a> (from <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/how-many-charging-points">Zapmap</a>), and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-statistics#latest-quarterly-electric-vehicle-charging-device-grant-scheme-statistics">the number of devices installed through OZEV grants</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="planning-legislation">Planning legislation in England</h3>
      The rules about planning permission for EV chargers are not decided by OZEV, but rather by parliament through the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/596/schedule/2">General Permitted Development Order</a>.
      <h3 id="taxation">Taxation (UK)</h3>
      The levels of VAT on public charging and home charging are ultimately down to HM Treasury. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has <a href="https://youtu.be/awctgZG_Lb0?t=1104&si=v-YEfV37Amln3bHZ">said</a>, 'I think I'd be sort of vaporised by the Treasury if I said, "Oh, I agree - we've got to cut the VAT [on public charging]."'
