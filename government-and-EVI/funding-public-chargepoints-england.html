    <h1>Funding Public Chargepoints in England</h1>
        The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles and its predecessor, the Office for Low Emission Vehicles, have funded several schemes for both public and private charging. This page gives more details on how schemes for public chargepoints work and how they can be benefit you. For information on schemes for home charging, please see our <a href="/home-charging/grants">grants</a> page.
      <h2>Chargepoint funding schemes in England</h2>
        <h3>Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI, 2022-present)</h3>
           <p>LEVI is the flagship programme for near-home public charging, with £381m of capital funding for new chargepoints across England. OZEV transfers this funding to highway authorities, who then set up tenders for the contract in their area.</p>
            <p>It is understood that LEVI will be the last government grant for near-home public chargepoints for some time, however there is no deadline on when your highway authority might spend their LEVI fund. It could go towards new chargepoint installations for years to come.</p>
            <p>To see how much your highway authority has received under LEVI, and how it is spending it, please enter your postcode:</p>

        <h3>On-street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS, 2017-2024)</h3>
           <p>The smaller-scale predecessor to LEVI was ORCS. You can also find out information on ORCS schemes in your local area by entering your postcode above.</p>
  
  Fundamental differences between LEVI and ORCS include:

It is not possible to discern the percentage contribution of the LEVI fund on a chargepoint-by-chargepoint basis. The percentage contribution of the LEVI fund to a highway authority's portfolio will vary across the country.</td>
