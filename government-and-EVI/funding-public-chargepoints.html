    <h1>Funding Public Chargepoints</h1>
        The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles and its predecessor, the Office for Low Emission Vehicles, have funded several schemes for both public and private charging. This page gives more details on how schemes for public chargepoints work and how they can be benefit you. For information on schemes for home charging, please see our <a href="/home-charging/grants">grants</a> page.
      <h2>Chargepoint funding schemes in England</h2>
        <h3>Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI, 2022-present)</h3>
            LEVI is the flagship programme for near-home public charging, with £381m of capital funding for new chargepoints across England. OZEV transfers this funding to highway authorities, who then set up tenders for the contract in their area. It is understood that LEVI will be the last government grant for near-home public chargepoints for some time. To see how much your highway authority has received under LEVI, and how it is spending it, please enter your postcode:

        <h3>On-street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS, 2017-2024)</h3>
            The smaller-scale predecessor to LEVI was ORCS. Fundamental differences between LEVI and ORCS include:
  <ul>
    <li>The DfT determined the level of LEVI funding allocated to each highway authority from the start based on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-ev-infrastructure-levi-funding-amounts/local-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-levi-funding-allocation-methodology">this methodology</a>. Highway authorities did not have the option to reject LEVI funding or change the capital value. In contrast, local authorities applied for ORCS funding based on their own requirements.</li>
    <li>LEVI funding goes to the highway authority, whereas any local authority could apply for ORCS funding. In two-tier authorities, ORCS funding and LEVI funding might be administered by different authorities.</li>
    <li>The LEVI capital funding, being of a fixed nature, contributes towards a portfolio of chargepoints - the more, the better. On the other hand, the ORCS funding was applied discretely at 50% or 60% of the cost of each chargepoint (depending on which phase of the scheme).</li>
    <li>The total quantity spent on ORCS funding was around £81m (adding up total for complete and incomplete projects from <a ref="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electric-vehicle-charging-device-grant-scheme-statistics-july-2025">these data</a>). LEVI funding is nearly five times as high, and the number of chargepoints this yields is hoped to be even higher than five times the number of ORCS chargepoints because of economies of scale, greater commercial incentives, and changes in capital costs.</li>

      <h2>Investments in chargepoint operators</h2>
          Public money is also going towards public chargepoints via investment in chargepoint operators. This is mainly through the Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund (CIIF), managed by <a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/192-zouk-capital-announced-as-preferred-bidder-for-the-charging-infrastructure-investment-fund">Zouk Capital</a> on behalf of HM Treasury. It launched in 2019 and after the third round of funding closed in 2021, the fund held £380m, half of which was public money. The fund has invested in the following chargepoint operators:
          <ul>
            <li>Instavolt (since sold by Zouk Capital in 2022)</li>
            <li>Believ (known as Liberty Charge at the point the CPO <a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/227-liberty-global-ventures-and-zouk-capital-partner-in-electric-vehicle-charging-joint-venture-liberty-charge">began</a> as a joint venture between Zouk Capital and Liberty Global in 2020)</li>
            <li>Char.gy (<a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/321-char-gy-secures-100m-funding-commitment-to-expand-uks-on-street-ev-charging-infrastructure">£100m commitment</a> as of June 2024)</li>
            <li>Zest (<a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/312-zouk-capital-increases-its-commitment-in-zest-to-105m-through-the-charging-infrastructure-investment-fund">£105m commitment</a> as of January 2024.</li>
          </ul>
        The CIIF has also <a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/318-zouk-capital-backs-35m-investment-in-ev-charging-company-energy-park">invested £35m</a> in Energy Park, which is not a public CPO but installs chargepoints for flats.
        <p>There are other examples of public money going into chargepoint operators. The National Wealth Fund <a href="https://www.nationalwealthfund.org.uk/news/connected-kerb-secures-ps65m-backing-national-wealth-fund-and-aviva-accelerate-uks-ev-public">invested</a> £55m in Connected Kerb in January 2025.</p>
