    <h1>Funding Public Chargepoints</h1>
        The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles and its predecessor, the Office for Low Emission Vehicles, have funded several schemes for both public and private charging. This page gives more details on how schemes for public chargepoints work and how they can be benefit you. For information on schemes for home charging, please see our <a href="/home-charging/grants">grants</a> page.
      <h2>Chargepoint funding schemes in England</h2>
        <h3>Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI, 2022-present)</h3>
           <p>LEVI is the flagship programme for near-home public charging, with £381m of capital funding for new chargepoints across England. OZEV transfers this funding to highway authorities, who then set up tenders for the contract in their area.</p>
            <p>It is understood that LEVI will be the last government grant for near-home public chargepoints for some time, however there is no deadline on when your highway authority might spend their LEVI fund. It could go towards new chargepoint installations for years to come.</p>
            <p>To see how much your highway authority has received under LEVI, and how it is spending it, please enter your postcode:</p>

        <h3>On-street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS, 2017-2024)</h3>
           <p>The smaller-scale predecessor to LEVI was ORCS. You can also find out information on ORCS schemes in your local area by entering your postcode above.</p>
  
  Fundamental differences between LEVI and ORCS include:

It is not possible to discern the percentage contribution of the LEVI fund on a chargepoint-by-chargepoint basis. The percentage contribution of the LEVI fund to a highway authority's portfolio will vary across the country.</td>

      <h2>Investments in chargepoint operators</h2>
          Public money is also going towards public chargepoints via investment in chargepoint operators. This is mainly through the Charging Infrastructure Investment Fund (CIIF), managed by <a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/192-zouk-capital-announced-as-preferred-bidder-for-the-charging-infrastructure-investment-fund">Zouk Capital</a> on behalf of HM Treasury. It launched in 2019 and after the third round of funding closed in 2021, the fund held £380m, half of which was public money. The fund has invested in the following chargepoint operators:
          <ul>
            <li>Instavolt (since sold by Zouk Capital in 2022)</li>
            <li>Believ (known as Liberty Charge at the point the CPO <a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/227-liberty-global-ventures-and-zouk-capital-partner-in-electric-vehicle-charging-joint-venture-liberty-charge">began</a> as a joint venture between Zouk Capital and Liberty Global in 2020)</li>
            <li>Char.gy (<a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/321-char-gy-secures-100m-funding-commitment-to-expand-uks-on-street-ev-charging-infrastructure">£100m commitment</a> as of June 2024)</li>
            <li>Zest (<a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/312-zouk-capital-increases-its-commitment-in-zest-to-105m-through-the-charging-infrastructure-investment-fund">£105m commitment</a> as of January 2024.</li>
          </ul>
        The CIIF has also <a href="https://www.zouk.com/news/38-infrastructure/318-zouk-capital-backs-35m-investment-in-ev-charging-company-energy-park">invested £35m</a> in Energy Park, which is not a public CPO but installs chargepoints for flats.
        <p>There are other examples of public money going into chargepoint operators. The National Wealth Fund <a href="https://www.nationalwealthfund.org.uk/news/connected-kerb-secures-ps65m-backing-national-wealth-fund-and-aviva-accelerate-uks-ev-public">invested</a> £55m in Connected Kerb in January 2025.</p>
