    <h1>Government Reports, Parliamentary Papers, and Think Tank and Industry Reports</h1>
    <p>How do we know what the government is trying to do when it comes to EV infrastructure? Who marks their homework? How do organisations outside of government assess the government's actions and their position?</p>
    <p>This section is dedicated to compiling the numerous reports on EV infrastructure in the UK, for easy reference to the government's ideas and other ideas from other organisations.</p>
    <p>This page involves political views, so it is important to be clear who has said what. For that reason, it is organised as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#government-reports">Government reports</a> come first, labelled by the administration under which they were published</li>
    <li><a href="#parliamentary-papers">Parliamentary reports</a> follow, labelled by the group within parliament which published them</li>
    <li>Finally, <a href="think-tanks">reports by think tanks and industry bodies</a> come last, labelled by the author</li>
  </ul>
All links are labelled by the date of publication, and within each section of the page, the reports will be listed from newest to oldest.
