      <h3 id="contracts-with-chargepoint-operators">Contracts with chargepoint operators</h3>
      It may be the government providing capital through schemes like ORCS and LEVI, however the chargepoint operators who run public chargepoints with this funding are appointed by local councils. You can see an example of a tender process for a LEVI contract with Brighton and Hove City Council <a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/027669-2024">here</a>. Enter your postcode above to see how much your local authority has received from the government, whether they have appointed a chargepoint operator and how many chargepoints they have installed with funding. 
      <h3 id="cables-across-pavements">Cables across pavements, cable covers and cross-pavement channels</h3>
      Your highway authority is also responsible for:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Deciding whether you can trail a charging cable over the pavement outside your house (usually no, though some permit this with cable protectors)</li>
    <li>Pursuing enforcement action against you if you do so</li>
    <li>Deciding whether you can install a cross-pavement channel, and in many cases assessing your application and commissioning the installation of your cross-pavement channel</li>
</ul>
  <h3 id="section-50-licences-or-street-works-permits">Section 50 licences or street works permits</h3>
      <p>In short, it is also up to highway authorities to manage installations on the highway regardless of the source of funding. </p>
      <p>Chargepoint operators do not have the same statutory right to operate on the highway as utility companies working on water, gas and mains electricity networks. They usually apply to the local highway authority under Section 50 of the New Roads and Streets Act. However, the government has sought to change this method of approval.</p>
