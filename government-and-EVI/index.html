    <h1>Government and EVI</h1>
    <p>Neither national nor local government set up petrol stations, so why should they get involved with EV infrastructure? This is a common question within the industry, particularly from EV sceptics, who feel the government is working against people's wishes to continue using petrol and diesel vehicles.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of answers. Firstly, the <a href="/sustainable-travel">climate impact</a> of petrol and diesel cars is severe. Secondly, many public chargepoints are on highway or other council land, so <a href="/government-and-EVI/local-government">local governments</a> are necessarily involved. Thirdly, the capital expenditure for EV charging is severe, and the government can <a href="government-and-EVI/funding-public-chargepoints/>help reduce this barrier</a> to allow the public chargepoint network to stand on its own feet.</p>

    <h2 id="national-government-and-EVI">National government and EVI</h2>
    The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-zero-emission-vehicles">Office for Zero Emission Vehicles</a> (OZEV) is the government's main arm for all things EV, including charging. It is part of the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).

      <h3 id="funding-public-chargepoints">Funding public chargepoints</h3>
      One of OZEV's roles is to subsidise the installation of public chargepoints. This does not mean subsidising the energy dispensed by public chargepoints. There have been various schemes through which the government has subsidised public chargepoints, most notably the On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS) and the Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) fund. See the <a href="/public-charging/funding-public-chargepoints">Funding public chargepoints</a> page for more information.
      <h3 id="funding-private-chargepoints">Funding private chargepoints</h3>
      OZEV also offer several grants to residents, landlords and businesses wishing to install home charging units at their properties. The full list of these grants is on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grants">this page</a> on the OZEV website, and we have more information about home charging grants <a href="/home-charging/grants">here</a>.
      <h3 id="regulating-public-chargepoints">Regulating public chargepoints</h3>
      OZEV are also in charge of the Public Charge Point Regulations 2023, which ensure that chargepoint operators (CPOs) provide a good service to the public. Please see our <a href="/public-charging/regulations">PCPR2023</a> page for more information.
      <h3 id="information">Information</h3>
      <p>OZEV's role in providing information on EV charging includes mythbusting and the provision of statistics to the industry and the public.</p>
      <p>OZEV have got an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicles-costs-charging-and-infrastructure/electric-vehicles-costs-charging-and-infrastructure">information page</a> on EVs in general. They also work with AutoTrader on a <a href="https://www.autotrader.co.uk/content/features/electric-cars-facts-and-figures">Facts and Figures</a> guide looking at the main downsides of EVs. However, the Lords Climate Change Committee has previously <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5804/ldselect/ldenvcl/51/5105.htm#_idTextAnchor006">urged</a> the government to do more to build consumer confidence. EVinfrastructure.co.uk seeks to provide information independently of the government.</p>
      <p>Statistics that OZEV produce include <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-statistics#latest-quarterly-electric-vehicle-public-charging-infrastructure-statistics">the number of EV charging devices in each local authority</a> (from <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/how-many-charging-points">Zapmap</a>), and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-statistics#latest-quarterly-electric-vehicle-charging-device-grant-scheme-statistics">the number of devices installed through OZEV grants</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="planning-legislation">Planning legislation</h3>
      The rules about planning permission for EV chargers are not decided by OZEV, but rather by parliament through the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/596/schedule/2">General Permitted Development Order</a>.
      <h3 id="taxation">Taxation</h3>
      The levels of VAT on public charging and home charging are ultimately down to HM Treasury. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has <a href="https://youtu.be/awctgZG_Lb0?t=1104&si=v-YEfV37Amln3bHZ">said</a>, 'I think I'd be sort of vaporised by the Treasury if I said, "Oh, I agree - we've got to cut the VAT [on public charging]."'
    
  <h2 id="local-government-and-EVI">Local government and EVI</h2>
    For more information on all the below points, including in your local authority, please see our <a href="/government-and-EVI/local-government">local government</a> page.
      <h3 id="contracts-with-chargepoint-operators">Contracts with chargepoint operators</h3>
      It may be the government providing capital through schemes like ORCS and LEVI, however the chargepoint operators who run public chargepoints with this funding are appointed by local councils. You can see an example of a tender process for a LEVI contract with Brighton and Hove City Council <a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/027669-2024">here</a>.
      <h3 id="section-50-licences-or-street-works-permits">Section 50 licences or street works permits</h3>
      <p>In short, it is also up to highway authorities to manage installations on the highway regardless of the source of funding. </p>
      <p>Chargepoint operators do not have the same statutory right to operate on the highway as utility companies working on water, gas and mains electricity networks. They usually apply to the local highway authority under Section 50 of the New Roads and Streets Act. However, the government has sought to change this method of approval.</p>
      <h3 id="cables-across-pavements">Cables across pavements, cable covers and cross-pavement channels</h3>
      Your highway authority is also responsible for:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Deciding whether you can trail a charging cable over the pavement outside your house (usually no, though some permit this with cable protectors)</li>
    <li>Pursuing enforcement action against you if you do so</li>
    <li>Deciding whether you can install a cross-pavement channel, and in many cases assessing your application and commissioning the installation of your cross-pavement channel</li>
</ul>
