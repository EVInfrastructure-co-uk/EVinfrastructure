    <h1>Government and EVI</h1>
    <p>Neither national nor local government set up petrol stations, so why should they get involved with EV infrastructure? This is a common question within the industry, particularly from EV sceptics, who feel the government is working against people's wishes to continue using petrol and diesel vehicles.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of answers. Firstly, the <a href="/sustainable-travel">climate impact</a> of petrol and diesel cars is severe. Secondly, many public chargepoints are on highway or other council land, so <a href="/government-and-EVI/local-government">local governments</a> are necessarily involved. Thirdly, the capital expenditure needed for EV chargepoints is substantial, and the government can <a href="/government-and-EVI/funding-public-chargepoints">help reduce this barrier</a> to allow the public chargepoint network to stand on its own feet.</p>
    <p>This section of the website contains pages on <a href="/government-and-evi/national-government">national government</a> including key players the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV), <a href="/government-and-evi/local-government">local government</a> including your local authority, <a href="/government-and-EVI/funding-public-chargepoints">funding public chargepoints</a>, devolved functions in <a href="/government-and-evi/scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="/government-and-evi/wales">Wales</a> and <a href="/government-and-evi/ni">Northern Ireland</a>, and a <a href="/government-and-evi/reports">reference guide</a> to the various reports by government, parliament or think tanks around EVI.</p>
    <p>The table below visualises where different responsibilities for EVI lie:</p>
