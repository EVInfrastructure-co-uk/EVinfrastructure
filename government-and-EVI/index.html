    <h1>Government and EVI</h1>
    <p>Neither national nor local government set up petrol stations, so why should they get involved with EV infrastructure? This is a common question within the industry, particularly from EV sceptics, who feel the government is working against people's wishes to continue using petrol and diesel vehicles.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of answers to this. Firstly, the <a href="/sustainable-travel">climate impact</a> of petrol and diesel cars is severe. Secondly, many public chargepoints are on highway or other council land, so local governments are necessarily involved. Thirdly, the capital expenditure for EV charging is severe, and the government can help reduce this barrier to allow the chargepoint network to stand on its own feet.</p>

    <h2>The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles and EVI</h2>
    The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-zero-emission-vehicles">Office for Zero Emission Vehicles</a> (OZEV) is the government's main arm for all things EV, including charging. It is part of the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ).
