    <h1>About EVinfrastructure.co.uk</h1>
    <p>This website aims to democratise information about charging EVs in the UK.<br>
      <br>
       When working in EV infrastructure, I have found the world of charging arcane. However, the challenge is too important for people to feel lost when it comes to charging their car, understanding developments in EVI, and ensuring they can represent their position to policymakers.<br>
      <br>
      Inspired by <a href="https://www.seat61.com/">The Man in Seat 61</a> and <a href="https://bustimes.org/">bustimes.org</a>, independent websites which help people find information about other modes of transport, I started EVinfrastructure.co.uk in 2025.<br>
      <br>There was a time before you knew what 'unleaded' and '135p/l' meant, before you knew who BP and Shell were, and before you could navigate to your nearest petrol station blindfolded. EVinfrastructure.co.uk is here for the journey towards similar household knowledge about EV charging.

  <h2>What EVinfrastructure.co.uk is <em>not</em></h2>
    <ul>
  <li>The best way to find a public chargepoint right now. <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Zapmap</a> is best for that.</li>
  <li>The best way to keep up with the latest news in the fast-moving world of EV infrastructure. Tom Riley's <a href="https://www.fastcharge.email/">Fast Charge</a> is best for that, especially if you work in EV infrastructure. While EVinfrastructure.co.uk will be up to date, it is for reference, not news.</li>
  <li>A marketing vehicle for any product, service, or segment of EV infrastructure.</li>
  <li>An organisation to lobby elected officials with policy demands.</li>
  <li>A support body for public servants. While I hope EVinfrastructure.co.uk is helpful for local authority officers and civil servants, and there will be overlap with information from the <a href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/service/local-government-support-programme/">Energy Saving Trust</a> and <a href="https://nevis.cenex.co.uk/">NEVIS</a>, the Department for Transport has contracted these services to support those working in the public sector on EV infrastructure, whereas EVinfrastructure.co.uk has no relationship with any public body.</li>
  <li>A site about driving electric cars. <a href="https://fullycharged.show/">Everything Electric</a> have been going since 2010 with their YouTube channel on EVs, and the <a href="https://ev-database.org/uk/">Electric Vehicle Database</a> is good for reference. This site's focus is energy transfer into and out of the battery.</li>
