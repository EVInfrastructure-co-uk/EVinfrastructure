    <h1>About EVinfrastructure.co.uk</h1>
</div>
  <p>There was a time before you knew what 'unleaded' and '135p/l' meant, who BP and Shell were, and how to get to your nearest petrol station blindfolded. EVinfrastructure.co.uk is here for the journey towards similar household knowledge about EV charging.</p>
    <p>If you are a citizen with questions, a journalist, an elected representative, or someone with a commercial interest in EV charging, then you are in the right place. Welcome!</p>
    <p>The world of EV charging is arcane. However, the challenge is too important for people to feel lost when it comes to charging their car, understanding developments in EVI, and representing their position to policymakers.</p>
    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.seat61.com/">The Man in Seat 61</a> and <a href="https://bustimes.org/">bustimes.org</a>, EVinfrastructure.co.uk started in 2025.</p>
  <h2>What EVinfrastructure.co.uk is <em>not</em></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The best way to find a public chargepoint right now. <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/">Zapmap</a> is best for that.</li>
      <li>The best way to keep up on the inside of the fast-moving world of EV infrastructure. Tom Riley's <a href="https://www.fastcharge.email/">Fast Charge</a> is best for that. EVinfrastructure.co.uk is for reference, not news.</li>
      <li>A site about driving electric cars. <a href="https://fullycharged.show/">Everything Electric</a> have been going since 2010 with their YouTube channel on EVs, and the <a href="https://ev-database.org/uk/">Electric Vehicle Database</a> is good for reference. This site's focus is energy transfer into and out of the battery.</li>
      <li>A marketing vehicle for any product, service, or segment of EV infrastructure.</li>
      <li>An organisation to lobby elected officials with policy demands.</li>
    </ul>
