    <h1>The Driveway Divide</h1>
      The driveway divide separates those who have the option of charging at home from those who don't. Can you park on your property and connect to your home's mains electricity? Nearly everyone who has a driveway charges their EV at home, nearly always with a dedicated home charging unit.
    <h2>Tariffs</h2>
      <a href="/home-charging/tariffs.html">Home charging tariffs</a> can be as low as 7p/kWh, while the <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/charging-price-index">Zapmap price index</a> for slow/fast public charging sits at 51p/kWh and even the lowest <a href="/public-charging/tariffs.html" >public charging tariffs</a> are higher than the domestic price cap of 26p/kWh.<br>
      <br>      
      With petrol at 135p/l, the per-mile equivalent EV charging tariff is around 54p/kWh (assuming, as a rule of thumb, efficiencies of 4 miles per kilowatt-hour and 10 miles per litre).<br>
      <br>
      As such, the driveway divide means the haves get mileage much cheaper than petrol, while, depending on the efficiency of their car and the price of local charging, some have-nots are dependent on charging that costs more than fuel.
      <h3>Why is home charging so much cheaper?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>VAT is 20% on public charging and only 5% on domestic electricity. This disparity is sometimes called a "pavement tax" and campaigns like <a href="https://www.faircharge.co.uk/">Fair Charge</a> aim to change this.</li>
        <li>The capital expenditure for public charging is considerable and is borne by the public chargepoint operator (perhaps with some <a href="/government-and-EVI/funding-public-chargepoints.html">subsidy</a>). In comparison, home charging units are funded by the user, usually for less than £1000.</li>
        <li>Price competition is far stronger between domestic electricity suppliers than public chargepoint operators. This is because you have the power to switch your home electricity supplier if they charge more than alternatives, whereas public chargepoint options are limited by distance and convenience.</li>
        <li>Adrian Fielden-Gray of chargepoint operator Be.EV has <a href="https://www.transportxtra.com/publications/evolution/opinion/77174/the-price-of-ev-charging-look-beyond-the-headlines/">summarised</a> the reasons public charging costs so much: "Public EV charging prices reflect the realities of building a reliable, future-proof network — not profiteering."</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Does the driveway divide matter?</h2>
      <p>Ask someone keen to reduce their carbon footprint but dependent on petrol because they have no driveway. Now ask someone who is apathetic about climate change, and dependent on petrol because they have no driveway.</p>
      <h3>Zapmap's survey suggests it matters</h3>
      <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/home-and-community-charging">Zapmap</a>'s survey found that 20% of EV drivers did not have a chargepoint at home. This is far lower than the 33% of all households which <a href="https://field-dynamics.co.uk/research/on-street-report-2024/">Field Dynamics</a> estimate do not have a driveway. This shows that the driveway divide is key to the question of fuel car or EV.
      <h3>The Electric Vehicle Association suggest it matters</h3>
      EVA England's 2025 report <a href="https://www.evaengland.org.uk/2025/02/20/key-steps-to-driving-zev-demand/">Key Steps to Driving Demand</a> contains 3 key recommendations on the issues of the "charging divide" and discusses the risk that those without driveways pay more to transition to EVs.
      <h3>Even The Observer suggest it matters!</h3>
      Observer columnist Ros Coward <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/four-years-after-buying-an-electric-car-why-am-i-still-forced-to-play-hunt-the-charger">discussed</a> her decision to transition back to a fuel car after her experiences driving an EV without a driveway. The Observer has been generally positive about EVs, so this was a notable article.

      <h3>Other barriers</h3>
    <h2>Solutions</h2>
  <h3>Crossing the driveway divide</h3>
      <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels.html">Cross-pavement channels</a> are designed for the very purpose of allowing those without driveways to access their home energy supply. However, they are not available everywhere and have issues of their own. 
  <h3>Narrowing the driveway divide</h3>
        Drivers in households like flats above the ground floor are unlikely ever to have access to charging on their home supply.
