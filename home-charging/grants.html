    <h1>Home Charging Grants </h1>
  <p>Since 2022, grants for home chargers have become more exclusive. Most prospective EV drivers will not be eligible for a grant for their <a href="/home-charging/chargers">home charger</a>, which costs around £1000. However, those who are renting or will be using a cross-pavement channel may get £350 towards charger installation from the government, and there are options for landlords and workplaces.</p>
    <p>Gov.uk has got a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grants">list</a> of chargepoint grants available at the moment. This page gives an overview of those grants and some more information about applying for them, as well as details of uptake and previous schemes (from data <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electric-vehicle-charging-device-grant-scheme-statistics-july-2025">here</a>).</p>
    <h2>Grants available now</h2>
      <h3>Electric vehicle chargepoint grant (EVCG) for renters and flat owners</h3>
      <p>If you are renting either a house or a flat, or you own a flat, then you can apply for the government's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grant-household/eligibility">Electric vehicle chargepoint grant for renters and flat owners</a>. You must have off-street parking.</p>
      <p>You need to own or lease an electric vehicle, or have one on order, or use one for work, when you install your chargepoint.</p>
      <p>If you are eligible, then you ask your installer to start your claim before installing the charging unit. The government approves your installer's application before your installer completes the work. Then your invoice from your installer will show the grant deducted from your costs.</p>
      <h3>Electric vehicle chargepoint grant (EVCG) for landlords</h3>
      <p>Both domestic and residential landlords can apply for this grant.</p>
      <p>As a landlord, you must contact a chargepoint installer and agree the work to be done ahead of applying for the grant. You then create an account and make the application. The government approves your application before your installer completes the work. Then your invoice from your installer will show the grant deducted from your costs.</p>
      <h3>Electric vehicle chargepoint grant (EVCG) for households with on-street parking</h3>
      <p>If you do not have a driveway or other off-street parking and are installing a <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channel</a> with your highway authority's permission, then you will be eligible for £350 off the home charger.</p>
      <p>This grant only applies in the case of pavement channels. For more information, see our <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channels</a> page.</p>
      <h3>Workplace Charging Scheme, Depot Charging Scheme, grant for staff and fleets</h3>
      <p>Those who manage commercial operations or property may be eligible to apply for </p>
    <h2>Previously available grants</h2>
      <h3>Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme (EVHS, 2014-2022)</h3>
      <p>The Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme was the default for anyone installing a home charger between 2014 and 2022 because it was open to everyone.</p>
      <p>Total uptake of the EVHS was nearly 340,000 charging devices, which the government subsidised to a sum of over £140m, an average of £411 per chargepoint.</p>
      <h3>Domestic Recharge Scheme (DRS, 2013-2014)</h3>
      <p>Total uptake of the DRS was over 40,000 charging devices, at a time when electric vehicles were very much out of the ordinary.</p>

    <p>In the context of the <a href="/home-charging/driveway-divide">driveway divide</a>, the total number of home chargers subsidised by the government is more than four times the total number of public chargers in the UK as of October 2025, although the estimated £180m boost to drivers with driveways is much less than the <a href="/government/funding-public-chargepoints">LEVI</a> public charging scheme's £380m. However, because there is such a strong incentive to charge at home even without a grant, there is an argument that public money is better spent on the other side of the driveway divide. This may be why the government moved to the more restrictive system for home charger grants in 2022.</p>
    <p>Estimates for the money spent on the Domestic Recharge Scheme are based on the average subsidy of £879 per charging device across the first eight months of the EVHS, before the cap was reduced to £700 per charging device. While OZEV don't publish the total spend on the DRS or scheme conditions, a <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/news/new-government-ev-homecharge-scheme-starts-today-1st-september">Zapmap article</a> on the launch of the EVHS in 2014 suggests it covered 75% of the cost of home charger up to £1000. <a href="https://www.zap-map.com/news/number-electric-vehicles-uk-passes-13000">Another article</a> from the same period suggests that less than 14,000 EVs were registered at the time, which casts doubt on the 35,289 figure for 2014.</p>
