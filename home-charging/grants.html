    <h1>Home Charging Grants </h1>
    <p>Most drivers will not be eligible for a grant for their <a href="/home-charging/chargers">home charger</a>, which costs around £1000. However, those who are renting or will be using a cross-pavement channel may get £350 (£500 from April 2026) towards charger installation from the government, and there are options for landlords and workplaces.</p>

    <h2 id="current">Grants available now</h2>
    <p>GOV.UK has got a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grants">list</a> of chargepoint grants available at the moment. This page gives an overview and more information about applying.</p>
      <h3 id="flats-and-renters">Electric vehicle chargepoint grant (EVCG) for renters and flat owners</h3>
      <p>If you are renting either a house or a flat, or you own a flat, then you can apply for the government's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grant-household/eligibility">Electric vehicle chargepoint grant for renters and flat owners</a>. You must have off-street parking.</p>
      <p>You need to own or lease an electric vehicle, or have one on order, or use one for work, when you install your chargepoint.</p>
      <p>If you are eligible, then you ask your installer to start your claim before installing the charging unit. The government approves your installer's application before your installer completes the work. Then your invoice from your installer will show the grant deducted from your costs.</p>
      <h3 id="landlords">Electric vehicle chargepoint grant (EVCG) for landlords</h3>
      <p>Both domestic and residential landlords can apply for this grant.</p>
      <p>As a landlord, you must contact a chargepoint installer and agree the work to be done ahead of applying for the grant. You then create an account and make the application. The government approves your application before your installer completes the work. Then your invoice from your installer will show the grant deducted from your costs.</p>
      <h3 id="channel">Electric vehicle chargepoint grant (EVCG) for households with on-street parking</h3>
      <p>If you do not have a driveway or other off-street parking and are installing a <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channel</a> with your highway authority's permission, then you will be eligible for £350 (£500 from April 2026) off the home charger.</p>
      <p>This grant only applies in the case of pavement channels. For more information, see our <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channels</a> page.</p>
      <h3 id="scotland">Scotland: Rural and Islands grant, and Cross-pavement grant</h3>
      <p>Details of the <a href="/government/scotland#domestic-charge-point-funding">domestic charge point grant</a> for islands and rural areas, and <a href="/government/scotland#channels">cross-pavement charging grant</a> for East Lothian, Renfrewshire, and Perth and Kinross are on our <a href="/government/scotland">Scotland page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="workplace">Workplace Charging Scheme, Depot Charging Scheme, grant for staff and fleets</h3>
      <p>Those who manage commercial operations or property may be eligible to apply for the Workplace Charging Scheme, Depot Charging Scheme or grant for staff and fleets. The latter will close in April 2026.</p>
    <h2 id="previous">Previously available grants</h2>
      <h3 id="evhs">Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme (EVHS, 2014-2022)</h3>
      <p>The Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme was the default for anyone installing a home charger between 2014 and 2022 because it was open to everyone.</p>
      <p>Total uptake of the EVHS was nearly 340,000 charging devices, which the government subsidised to a sum of over £140m, an average of £411 per chargepoint.</p>
      <h3 id="drs">Domestic Recharge Scheme (DRS, 2013-2014)</h3>
      <p>Total uptake of the DRS was over 40,000 charging devices, at a time when electric vehicles were very much out of the ordinary. Having an EV was not a requirement for the grant.</p>
    <h2 id="total">Total grant uptake for residential properties to 2024</h2>

    <p>The government has spent more on public chargers than this £180m on home chargers. However, the number of subsidised home chargers is more than four times the number of public chargers in the UK as of October 2025.</p>
    <p>Because of the other incentives to charge at home, there is an argument that public money is better spent on public charging. This may be why the government moved to the more restrictive system for home charger grants in 2022.</p>
    <h3>Sources</h3>
    <p>Most details of uptake for previous schemes come from GOV.UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electric-vehicle-charging-device-grant-scheme-statistics-july-2025">Electric vehicle charging device grant scheme statistics</a>.</p>
    <p>Estimates for the money spent on the Domestic Recharge Scheme are based on the average subsidy of £879 per charging device across the first eight months of the EVHS, when it had the same £1000 cap as the Domestic Recharge Scheme. The reason 2014 stands out so much is that having an EV was not a requirement for the grant.</p>
