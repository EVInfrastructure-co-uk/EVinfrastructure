    <h1>Pavement channels and charging gullies</h1>
    <p>The terms <i>pavement channels, cross-pavement channels, cross-pavement solutions, gullies</i> all refer to mechanisms for allowing those without driveways to connect to their home electricity supply when their car is parked on street. This enables them to cross the <a href="/home-charging/driveway-divide">driveway divide</a>.</p>
    <p>Cross-pavement channels have been around since 2022, when <a href="https://news.oxfordshire.gov.uk/volunteers-test-out-uk-first-on-street-electric-vehicle-charger/">trials of Gul-e</a> took place in Oxfordshire. However, interest has increased as EVs become more mainstream, Dragon's Den's Deborah Mead invested in Kerbo Charge, and the government announced grants to residents for their home charger if they use a cross-pavement channel, and to highway authorities to subsidise channels.</p>
      <h2>Can I get a pavement channel?</h2>
      Your highway authority decides whether you can get a pavement channel. They often decide how much you will have to pay, require you to sign a licence which ensures conditions of use, and may charge an annual fee to cover any maintenance. In two-tier areas, this will be your county council. In unitary areas, this will be your unitary authority.
