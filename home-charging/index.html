    <h1>Home charging</h1>
    <p>By all accounts, home charging is the cheapest and most convenient way to charge your car. The vast majority of EV drivers charge at home, and there may be over 1 million home chargers in the UK, based on the number of EVs and the available statistics on uptake of home chargers per EV. Costs vary depending on supplier and time of use, but charging can be as cheap as 7p/kWh.</p>
    <p>This section includes details on <a href="/home-charging/tariffs">tariffs</a>, <a href="/home-charging/chargers">chargers</a> and <a href="/home-charging/grants">grants</a> for those who can charge at home, discussion of the <a href="/home-charging/driveway-divide">driveway divide</a> separating those who can charge at home from those who can't, and information about <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channels</a>, which can help some residents cross the divide.</p>
