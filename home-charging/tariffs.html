    <h1>Home Charging Tariffs</h1>
    <h2>The best EV tariffs</h2>
 <p>The best home electricity tariffs for EV drivers either reward you for plugging in at night or act as "add-ons" where EV charging is charged at a separate rate to the rest of your electricity. Either way, you can benefit from EV charging at less than 10p/kWh. This compares with the Ofgem price cap of 26p/kWh and public charging tariffs, with the Zapmap Price Index for slow/fast charging at 52p/kWh.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/ev-energy-tariffs/">MoneySavingExpert</a> and the <a href="https://electriccarguide.co.uk/the-best-ev-tariff/">Electric Car Guide</a> have good information on home charging tariffs. Competition between suppliers is strong, so they tend to publish their tariffs far and wide, and change fairly often.</p>

  <h2>Deals with chargers, energy suppliers, and vehicle manufacturers</h2>
  <h2>Considerations</h2>
  <h3>Smart meters and smart chargers</h3>
  The best EV tariffs are with smart meters, and are even better when paired with smart <a href="/home-charging/chargers">chargers</a> that ensure charging only takes place during cheap hours.
  <h3>Look at the whole cost of your energy usage, not just the EV tariffs</h3>
  There's no point paying 7p/kWh on your EV charging if you find yourself paying more for the rest of your electricity. That said, if you begin a time-of-us tariff to charge your EV, you can also benefit from running your dishwasher and washing machine overnight on a timer.
