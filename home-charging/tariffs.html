    <h1>Home Charging Tariffs</h1>
    <h2>The best EV tariffs</h2>
 <p>The best home electricity tariffs for EV drivers either reward you for plugging in at night or act as "add-ons" where EV charging is charged at a separate rate to the rest of your electricity. Either way, you can benefit from EV charging at less than 10p/kWh. This compares with the Ofgem price cap of 26p/kWh and <a href="/public-charging/tariffs">public charging tariffs</a>, with the Zapmap Price Index for slow/fast charging at 52p/kWh.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/ev-energy-tariffs/">MoneySavingExpert</a> and the <a href="https://electriccarguide.co.uk/the-best-ev-tariff/">Electric Car Guide</a> have good information on home charging tariffs. Competition between suppliers is strong, so they tend to publish their tariffs far and wide, and change fairly often.</p>

  <h2 id="deals">Deals involving EV tariffs, chargers, vehicle manufacturers, and public charging</h2>
  <p>Because energy suppliers are keen for your custom, they often work with partners to give perks. Sometimes signing onto an energy tariff gets you the perk, while other times a certain tariff is itself a perk of buying a certain kind of vehicle or chargepoint. Keep your eye out for this sort of thing, but if you a making a big purchase like a car or a chargepoint, remember that home tariffs are so low that a free mileage or energy allowance may only end up saving you £200 or so.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Until 28 October 2025, British Gas and Centrica's stablemate home <a href="/home-charging/chargers">charger</a> company Hive offer 2,290kWh free if you install a Hive charger and use a British gas tariff.</li>
    <li>Good Energy's <a href="https://www.goodenergy.co.uk/renewable-ev-charging/">EV tariff</a> includes a subscription to <a href="https://www.goodenergy.co.uk/renewable-ev-charging/">Zapmap premium</a>, while <a href="https://www.eonnext.com/tariffs/next-drive">E.ON Next</a> customers get a free 1 year subscription to Zoom EV.</li>
    <li>Octopus offer the <a href="https://octopusev.com/power-pack-bundle">Power Pack Bundle</a>: a BYD Dolphin on lease, a home charger, and home charging up to 4000 kWh per year are all included for a monthly price which depends on the lease length and your mileage.</li>
    <li>Pod offer <a href="https://podenergy.com/">Pod Drive</a>: a home charger and home charging up to 7,500 miles per year for £40/month.</li>
    <li>Ford offer the <a href="https://www.ford.co.uk/hybrid-electric/charging/power-promise">Ford Power Promise</a>: a free home charger and £217 energy credit in association with Octopus Intelligent Go.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Considerations</h2>
  <h3>Smart meters and smart chargers</h3>
  The best EV tariffs are with smart meters, and are even better when paired with smart <a href="/home-charging/chargers">chargers</a> that ensure charging only takes place during cheap hours.
  <h3>Look at the whole cost of your energy usage, not just the EV tariffs</h3>
  There's no point paying 7p/kWh on your EV charging if you find yourself paying more for the rest of your electricity. That said, if you begin a time-of-use tariff to charge your EV, you can also benefit from running your dishwasher and washing machine overnight on a timer.
