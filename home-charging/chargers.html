<h1>Home chargers</h1>

<div>
<p>Most EV drivers who charge at home do so with a dedicated home charger or wallbox, generally installed on the front of their house for easy connection to a car on their driveway. The alternative is to run a cable to a standard domestic plug socket, which will charge your car slower, entail much higher electrical risk, and make you ineligible for the best home charging tariffs.</p>
<p>The government has a list of chargers which are eligible for grants. This page gives a drop-down version of those chargers, so you can find your way around the world of home chargers, and also discusses the differences between some home chargers and others.</p>
<h2>Installing a charger</h2>
  <h3>Planning permission</h3>
  <p>If you have a driveway, then installing a home charger will not require planning permission in general. There are exceptions if you live in a listed building or scheduled monument, or you want to install a giant home charger.</p>
  <p>If you do not have a driveway, then you will require planning permission, and are only likely to get this if your highway authority permits <a href="/home-charging/pavement-channels">pavement channels</a>. Most home charger installers will advise you that they will not install chargers where there are no driveways, although in the past rogue installers have been happy to go ahead, in breach of planning law.</p>
