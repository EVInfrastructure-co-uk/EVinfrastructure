    <h1>Energy</h1>
    <p>What exactly are you paying for when you charge your car?</p>
    <p>You are buying <strong>energy</strong>. Each <strong>kWh</strong> of energy costs you about 50p at a public chargepoint or less than 10p on the cheapest home tariff, and takes your car about 4 miles.</p>

  <h3>Spot the difference!</h3>
  <h2>kWh</h2>
  <p>Little k, big W, little h. This is a measure of energy, and relates to how far your car goes.</p>
  <p>The numbers you might expect to see in front of kWh are usually two digits, but depend on the <a href="#range">size of the battery</a> or how much you are depleting or recharging your battery. Only top of the range EVs have capacities over 100 kWh.</p>
  <h2>kW</h2>
  <p>Little k, big W. This is a measure of <a href="/what-is-a-watt/power-and-connectors">power</a>, and relates to how quickly energy flows into your car when you charge. We never thought about how quickly fuel flowed into a tank because filling up took a matter of seconds.</p>
  <p>The numbers you might expect to see in front of kW are 3, 7, 11, 22, 50, 100, 150, 350. This is because there are <a href="/what-is-a-watt/power-and-connectors">standard charging speeds</a>.</p>

Others take the UK's adoption of decimal currency and metric units (like grams of rice) as evidence we'll manage in the end.</p>

<h2>Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency</h2>
<p>Have a look at the bottom arrow in each flowchart above. EVs can go around three miles further on a kWh of energy than fuel cars can! Electric powertrains are much more efficient than fuel powertrains.</p>
<p>A kWh of electrical energy tends to cost more than a kWh of chemical energy in fuel, as per the top arrows in each flowchart above. But wait. If you can charge at home for less than 15p/kWh, then you are getting electrical energy cheaper than fuel energy, and each unit is taking you three times as far. This means your mileage is cheap as chips!</p>
<p>If you really want to compare mileage costs, then you need to take account of efficiencies of both types of car, incorporating the two little arrows above into one big arrow:</p>
<p>The rule of thumb is that petrol costs 13.5p/mile, and you need to divide your charging tariff by 4 to get p/mile. E.g. 54p/kWh is roughly 13.5p/mile.</p>
<p>Efficiency varies! Factors that influence EV efficiency include car weight, technical design, outside temperature, and driving environment (e.g. urban stop-start v motorway pedal-down).</p>
