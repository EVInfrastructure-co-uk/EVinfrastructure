    <h1>Energy</h1>
    <p>What exactly are you paying for when you charge your car?</p>
    <p>You are buying <strong>energy</strong>. Each <strong>kWh</strong> of energy costs you about 50p at a public chargepoint or less than 10p on the cheapest home tariff, and takes your car about 3 miles.</p>

  <h3>Spot the difference!</h3>
  <h2>kWh</h2>
  <p>Little k, big W, little h. This is a measure of energy, and relates to how far your car goes.</p>
  <h2>kW</h2>
  <p>Little k, big W. This is a measure of power, and relates to how quickly energy flows into your car when you charge. We never thought about how quickly fuel flowed into a tank because filling up took a matter of seconds.</p>

Others take the UK's adoption of decimal currency and metric unites (like grammes of rice) as evidence we can make the changes in the end.</p>
