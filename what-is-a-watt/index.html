    <h1>What is a Watt?</h1>
    <p>A Watt is a unit of power and tells you how quickly energy enters your car. If you charge at 7kW (power), then your battery will gain 7kWh (energy) every hour. The higher the kW rate you charge at, the quicker your battery fills up with energy.<br>
    <br>
    This part of the website is dedicated to getting your head around EV charging. If you can pick up fuel vehicle infrastructure from the world around you, then you can pick up electric vehicle infrastructure. It might be a change from what you know, and it might be more complicated, but it's not rocket science.</p>
    <p>This section is broken up into four pages: <a href="/what-is-a-watt/energy">energy</a>, <a href="/what-is-a-watt/power-and-connectors">power and connectors</a>, and <a href="/what-is-a-watt/earthing">earthing</a>. It also contains an <a href="/watt-is-a-what/A-Z">A to Z of EVI</a> for reference.</p>
