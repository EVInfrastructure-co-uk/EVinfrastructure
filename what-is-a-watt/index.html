    <h1>What is a Watt?</h1>
    <p>A Watt is a unit of power. It measures how quickly energy flows into your car!<br>
    <br>
    This part of the website is dedicated to getting your head around all the new language and concepts in EV charging. If you can pick up fuel vehicle infrastructure from the world around you, then you can pick up electric vehicle infrastructure too. It might be a change, especially having to think about the time it takes to charge, but it's not rocket science.</p>
    <p>This section is broken up into four pages: <a href="/what-is-a-watt/energy">energy</a>, <a href="/what-is-a-watt/power-and-connectors">power and connectors</a>, and <a href="/what-is-a-watt/earthing">earthing</a>. It also contains an <a href="/watt-is-a-what/A-Z">A to Z of EVI</a> for reference.</p>
