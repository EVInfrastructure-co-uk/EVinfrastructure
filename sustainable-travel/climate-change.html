<h1>EVs and Climate Change</h1>

<p>Electric vehicles are more efficient at converting input energy into mileage, and use cleaner energy as an input, so each mile in an EV has a considerably lower carbon footprint than each mile in a petrol car.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of the electric vehicle itself has a higher carbon footprint than the manufacturing of a fuel car. The battery accounts for this difference, however it is usually offset by lower-carbon mileage before the car has reached 20,000 miles. The more fuel miles are displaced, the bigger the impact, although a mile in an electric car still has a carbon impact bigger than a mile of car travel avoided entirely.</p>

<h2>The bigger picture</h2>
<p>In 2024, Finnish researchers published a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000346">study</a> which found that households with EVs had higher carbon footprints than households with non-EV cars.</p>

<p>How can it simultaneously be true that EVs are greener and that households with EVs have a lower carbon footprint? The key is that driving is not the be-all and end-all. Diet, heating, and aviation are all important factors in a person's carbon footprint, and it just so happens that in this Finnish study, the carbon footprint of other activities offset the carbon savings of EV households.</p>
<p>Note that households without cars comfortably have the lowest carbon footprint.</p>
<!-- That's why I have made households without a car dark green in the diagram on the state of the transition. -->
