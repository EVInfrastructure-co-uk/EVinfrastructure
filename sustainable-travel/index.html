    <p>Are EVs really green?</p>
    <p>No doubt you've heard this question before, and the related questions: Are they greener than fuel cars? How can we all get around in the greenest way?</p>
    <p>This section goes into more detail on the <a href="/sustainable-travel/climate-change">relationship between electric vehicles and climate change</a> and <a href="/sustainable-travel/v2g">vehicle-to-grid technology</a>, but here are some rules of thumb:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Of the many issues with cars, electrification only tackles two: greenhouse gas emissions and air quality. (They do happen to be two of the most important!)</li>
      <li>The best way to reduce transport emissions is to displace car journeys altogether. Walking, wheeling, cycling, public transport and shared transport are all greener - as is staying at home!</li>
      <li>For almost all drivers, EVs will have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than fuel cars.</li>
    </ol>
