    <p>Are EVs really green?</p>
    <p>No doubt you've heard this question before, and the related questions: Are they greener than fuel cars? How can we all get around in the greenest way?</p>
    <p>This section goes into more detail, but here are two rules of thumb:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cars come with many issues. Transitioning from fuel cars to electric cars only tackles two of these problems: greenhouse gas emissions; and air quality.</li>
      <li>The best way to reduce transport emissions is displacing car journeys altogether. Walking, wheeling, cycling, public transport and shared transport are all greener - as is staying at home! Electrification of car travel is second on the list. For almost all drivers, EVs will have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than fuel cars.</li>
    </ol>
